The program needs your "lig.gro" and "lig.itp". It will read your "lig.itp" and rearrange the order of atom in "lig.grp" respect to the order of atom in "[ atoms ]" section in "lig.itp".
After use the notebook, you will get new "lig_reordered.gro". Copy the new atom order in this file and paste in "solv.gro".

To run the code:

$ python reorder_lig_gro.py <lig.itp> <lig.gro> <out.gro>
