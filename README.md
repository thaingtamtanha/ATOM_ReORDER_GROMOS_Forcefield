# ATOM_ReORDER_GROMOS

This Python script is designed to help with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of protein-ligand complexes that require special topology preparation. It allows you to reorder your ligand.gro file to match the atom order specified in your ligand.itp file. To prepare your ligand.itp file, you can use the GROMOS forcefield available at https://atb.uq.edu.au/.  By using this script, you can ensure that your ligand atoms are correctly ordered, which is essential for performing accurate MD simulations. The script is easy to use and can save you time when preparing your system for simulations.
